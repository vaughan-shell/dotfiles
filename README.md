# dotfiles
All of my dot (config) files for common programs
Won't update super often, probably every couple days or so. Wouldn't really reccommend using these as your configs or basing youer configs of off these, there are better configs out there, but I figured it'd be handy if I made a repositroy so that if I distro-hop I wont have to rewrite my config files.
